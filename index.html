<p>I am currently a software engineer in Pittsburgh, Pennslyvania. I am interested in the intersection of systems programming and robotics/AI. Since robotics and ML/AI is so new, I like to read research papers and prototype different research ideas/projects, such as computer vision, reinforcement learning, and more recently LLMs.</p>
<p>I am proficient in Python, C++, Rust programming languages and am comfortable with cloud platforms in AWS, GCP, and Azure cloud platforms.</p>
<p>In my off-time, I like to watch movies, go for a hike, and just learn about all types of subject areas that interest me!</p></p>

A common way of optimizing for latency is to run key-value store client locally. In this project, I implemented a distributed message-driven system similar to the Akka programming framework (<a href="https://akka.io">Java Akka Framework</a>) API with actor semantics. This system provides high latency by hosting client key/value processes locally and high throughput by using all available cores on the local machine. In addition, the communication pattern with the remote servers are is minimized by having "relay processes" on each remote machine that would desseminate write messages to other remote processes. Consensus among the client and server programs in this system is reached among different local/remote key-value processes by the last-writer wins (LWW) policy. The system provides SLA guarantees that local writes are synced to local processes within 500ms and remote processes done within 2000ms.</p>
